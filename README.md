# phplogserver
Simple PHP log server for remote storage of logs.

I needed a simple server for logging errors of a JS project and couldn't find anything that matched what i needed, so I created this project.

The server logs JSON objects (really any strings) along with some metadata in a MySQL server and allows them to be displayed back.
